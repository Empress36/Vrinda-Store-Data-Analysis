## Summary

Vrinda store Annual Report for 2022  show that the Store made over 21 million in sales, with thousands of orders and customers. The report showed how sales went up and down each month. Women bought more clothes than men. Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra helped a lot with sales. The report also showed where most sales came from.

## Insights

1. **Order vs. Sales:** Analyzing the relationship between orders and sales can reveal the average order value and identify trends in customer spending.

2.  **Order Status:** Based on the Chart we can see that 93% of the goods are Delivered, 4% are Returned, 2% are Cancelled and 1% are Refunded.

3. **Men Vs Women:** The Chart show that Women Purchase more than Men

4. **Top States:** Knowing which states generate the most sales helps in focusing marketing efforts and optimizing distribution. 

5. **Order Vs Age:** Based on the Chart we can see that Adults from the Age of (20 - 69) Order most

6. **Sales Channels:** The performance of different channels (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra,Ajio, Nalli,Meesho and others) provides insights into where sales are strongest and where                improvements can be made.

7. **Monthly Trend sales:** There is more sales in March and Febuary than the remaining other months

## Recommendations 

1.  I would recommend that the company should focus more on men in sense that, they should advertise men clothes and to understand their preferences and needs. 

2.  The company should find the reasons for Returns, Cancellations and Refunds to identify the areas for improvent. 

3.  Invest more in the channels that generate the most sales and consider optimizing the underperfoming ones.

4.  I would also recommend that the company should Analyze factors contributing to the peak sales in March and Febuary, and then use the markerting strategies for the other months 

5.  To gather customer feedback to understand customer satisfaction

By implementing these recommendations, the company can leverage the insights to improve sales, optimize marketing efforts, and enhance overall business performance in 2023
